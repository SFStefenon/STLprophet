# Forecasting of Italian electricity spot prices

We present an application of the _Facebook's Prophet_ approach using _STL_.

The evaluation is performed relative to the time series of the Italy electricity spot prices, considering the values recorded from February 01, 2015 to November 30, 2022.

STL = Seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS.

LOESS = Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing.
