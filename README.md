# Forecasting of Italian electricity spot prices

We present an application of the _Facebook's Prophet_ approach using _STL_.

The evaluation is performed relative to the Italy electricity spot prices time series, considering the values recorded from 2015-01-02 to 2022-11-30.

STL = Seasonal and trend decomposition using LOESS.

LOESS = Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing.
